Data Analysis classification.


## Synopsis

Be given the "Parkinsons" dataset which represents the numerical values of 22 attributes extracted from 197 vocal recordings of 2 groups of people, the first affected by the disease of parkinson's, the other not. The dataset is presented as a matrix of 197 rows and 23 columns. We intend to compare the two Random Projection techniques and the Principal Component Analysis on the dataset in question through a chosen classification algorithm, able to distinguish between the two categories of objects (sick and not).
